          We would guess that a large portion of coffee drinkers might think
          operations are overseen by large estates equipped with the most robust
          mills and modern technology. But did you know that 70% of the world’s
          coffee producers can be characterized as “smallholder” farmers? It’s a
          stunning majority of the coffee industry. Smallholder farmers
          traditionally grow a mixture of cash and subsistence crops, which
          rarely exceed 5 hectares. A more important factor often overlooked is
          the role women have in our industry. While the numbers vary from study
          to study, some reports estimate that women make up 70% of the labor
          force on coffee farms; planting, processing, picking and sorting.
          Women are the hidden heroines of the coffee industry. They have a much
          lower representation when it comes to land ownership with estimates
          range from as little as 5% to higher estimates of 20% in
          coffee-growing countries. Amparo Maya Guerrero is one of the many
          smallholder farmers worldwide, with her plot clocking in at 3
          hectares. We touched down in Colombia to pay a special visit to a
          truly memorable woman and her farm in Chachagüí. When it was time to
          wrap and head back home, we all walked away buzzing with inspiration
          from her words of wisdom and excited to share our experience and her
          story with you all.

          Amparo’s farm, El Convento, grows avocados and citrus fruits alongside
          the beautiful rows of coffee trees. The combination of high altitude
          and moderate temperatures slow the rate of maturation but reward her
          cherries with heightened sweetness. Her signature sweet coffee awarded
          her first place in the Cup of Excellence in 2004 and again in 2008.
          The bright acidity in this single-origin espresso met with nectarine
          sweetness continues to blow us away every time we taste it. Amparo’s
          peaceful energy permeates the surrounding space and her commitment to
          and connection with the land is a palatable force. Her dedication and
          guiding principles are reflected in her coffee.

          Q: What has growing coffee taught you?
        </ArticleCardListH4>

        <ArticleCardListText>
          A: I have been farming coffee for 35 years. I really didn't know
          anything about coffee. It begins with the earth. In the earth is where
          we begin and we have to make the connection with the earth. We have to
          recognize that the earth is where the coffee starts and finds its
          significance. We have to see it, feel it, and listen to it to find
          what it tells you. There is so much to learn behind the coffee: there
          is an individual, a collective, social and a psychological component
          in coffee. Once you get all of the components, that is when the coffee
          becomes important, significant, valuable. In the fields, we have to
          learn to give respect and value to all of the things in the land. I
          take a sip from this coffee and ‘Wow, I need to share it.’ The
          personal aspect is that I have had to overcome a lot of things. First,
          the unknown from the field. Toxic masculinity is a big thing in the
          fields that I have had to deal with. I have had to fight hard in
          respect to this. I don't have anything against men; I treasure them
          and I do not think there is anything different between us. They are as
          strong and beautiful as a woman. Sometimes in the field when a woman
          feels tired, it is frowned upon. Men feel the same way: however, they
          do not show it.

          "When the whole world tells you that you can't, you begin to believe
          that you can't. But there is a moment where you have a glimmer of
          belief inside yourself that says 'you can' that you have to hold on
          to. Anything you have in your mind you can create. Everything in our
          mind is able to be unraveled and actualized."{" "}

          Q: How has coffee impacted your life?
        </ArticleCardListH4>

        <ArticleCardListText>
          A: Before I started farming coffee 35 years ago, I really didn't know
          anything about it. You cannot sit back and dwell on your misfortune.
          There is a learning in all of it. What is interesting about human
          beings is our ability to move beyond our problems. The problems we
          have encountered are infinite. At the end of the day, all your
          problems are nothing more than a silly scare. Behind the problem lies
          your fear. The problem is our opportunity to overcome the difficulties
          in the world. People die from fear.

          Q: What makes your connection with coffee so unique?
        </ArticleCardListH4>
        <ArticleCardListText>
          A: Coffee is a cultivar and apart from the highs and lows that is has
          and that it is not the easiest to manage. When I started in coffee, it
          felt impossible to make a difference. The biggest challenge is
          fighting your own ignorance. Second, you have to fight the outside
          voices that say you can't. You have to generate something unique, to
          be true to yourself and to serve those around you. It presents an
          amazing opportunity and we want to provide an incredible product. It's
          a perfect opportunity to share and communicate with the world through
          the end product.

          It is my opportunity to share my work with the people. It's an equal
          exchange between the drinker and me. You are drinking the final
          product of 35 years of work. You are drinking my strength and my love
          for life. It is my opportunity to share my work with the people. It's

          Q: Do you have any plans for the future?
        </ArticleCardListH4>
        <ArticleCardListText>
          A: I want to finish planting the farm. There is one more section to
          complete. But more importantly, my mission is to feed the people in
          Colombia. There are many that are suffering from hunger. I want to
          build an empire that creates a viable livelihood for me and for the
          people who work here. It is hard to raise the price of the coffee with
          the current coffee price crisis. There is always a speculative market
          that hurts us and does not have a conscience. There is a population
          that only wants money and that is a challenge; capitalism is such an
          intense force. It's a part of the unconscious of the world. But I know
          in my heart that we are all the same and we are all searching for the
          opportunity to unravel ourselves.
